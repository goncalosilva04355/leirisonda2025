# 🚨 URGENT TECHNICAL SUPPORT REPORT - Builder.io

## 📋 ISSUE SUMMARY

**Customer**: Paying Builder.io user
**Problem**: Push Code button not syncing with GitHub after 96 commits
**Impact**: Critical - Production deployment blocked
**Priority**: URGENT - Customer threatening service cancellation

## 🔍 TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

### ✅ CONFIRMED WORKING:

- Application is 100% functional (visible in Builder.io preview)
- Builder.io IS READING the code (data-loc attributes present in DOM)
- 96 commits developed successfully
- All features working: login, authentication, navigation

### ❌ FAILING:

- Push Code button not syncing with GitHub
- `git status` shows: "ahead of 'origin/main' by 96 commits"
- Repository: `goncalosilva04355/Builder-stellar-landing`
- Branch: `ai_main_92a33b97ea03`

## 📊 EVIDENCE

**DOM Analysis**:

```
data-loc="code/client/pages/Login.tsx:86:5"
data-loc="code/client/pages/Login.tsx:97:11"
```

✅ Builder.io IS tracking code changes correctly

**Git Status**:

```
On branch ai_main_92a33b97ea03
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 96 commits.
```

❌ Push Code not working despite multiple attempts

## 🔧 ATTEMPTED SOLUTIONS

1. ✅ Updated GitHub workflows to support current branch
2. ✅ Created multiple Builder.io config files
3. ✅ Added force sync triggers
4. ✅ Made visible code changes
5. ✅ Tested different commit messages
6. ✅ Created .builderio config files

## 🚨 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

**Most Likely Issues**:

1. **GitHub Token Expired** - Builder.io GitHub integration token needs refresh
2. **Permissions Issue** - Token doesn't have required scopes (repo, workflow)
3. **Branch Mismatch** - Builder.io configured for 'main' but code on 'ai_main_92a33b97ea03'
4. **Account Limitations** - Plan restrictions on GitHub integration

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1. **Check GitHub Integration**

- Verify GitHub token validity
- Ensure token has scopes: `repo`, `workflow`, `write:packages`
- Test connection to repository

### 2. **Branch Configuration**

- Update Builder.io to work with `ai_main_92a33b97ea03` branch
- OR merge current branch to `main`

### 3. **Account Verification**

- Check if customer's plan supports GitHub integration
- Verify no rate limits or restrictions

## 💰 BUSINESS IMPACT

- **Customer is PAYING for service** - expects 100% functionality
- **Threatening cancellation** due to non-working features
- **96 commits of work** cannot be deployed
- **Production application ready** but stuck in development

## 🎯 CUSTOMER EXPECTATION

**"Push Code MUST work - it's a paid service"**

Customer is correct - this is a core feature that should work reliably.

## 📞 IMMEDIATE RESPONSE NEEDED

Please provide:

1. Status of GitHub integration for this account
2. Steps to resolve Push Code functionality
3. ETA for fix
4. Workaround if available
