# Leirisonda SwiftUI Implementation

This directory contains the native SwiftUI implementation of the Leirisonda login screen, converted from the React web version.

## Features Implemented

### LoginView

- ✅ Blue gradient background matching the original design
- ✅ Leirisonda logo with proper positioning and shadow
- ✅ Email and password input fields with custom styling
- ✅ Remember me checkbox functionality
- ✅ Error message display (currently showing Firebase error as in original)
- ✅ Login button with loading states
- ✅ Form validation and disabled states
- ✅ Credential saving/loading via UserDefaults
- ✅ Proper safe area handling
- ✅ ScrollView for larger screens
- ✅ AsyncImage for remote logo loading

### Components

- **FormTextField**: Reusable form input component with the yellow background styling
- **LoadingView**: Generic loading state component
- **ErrorView**: Error display component with retry functionality

## Design Specifications

The SwiftUI implementation follows the original design:

- **Background**: Blue gradient (#3b82f6)
- **Input Fields**: Light yellow background (#f5f5b3) with gray borders
- **Logo**: White container with shadow, containing the Leirisonda logo
- **Typography**: System fonts with appropriate weights and sizes
- **Layout**: Centered form with proper spacing and padding

## Integration with Existing App

This SwiftUI implementation is designed to work alongside the existing Capacitor setup:

1. The main app still uses the hybrid web/native Capacitor approach
2. This SwiftUI code provides a native iOS login experience
3. Can be integrated by modifying the AppDelegate to show SwiftUI views when needed
4. Maintains compatibility with existing Firebase authentication

## Authentication Flow

The login view includes:

- Form validation
- Loading states during authentication
- Error handling and display
- Credential persistence with UserDefaults
- Integration points for Firebase authentication

## Preview Support

All views include `#Preview` implementations for easy development and testing in Xcode.

## Next Steps

To fully integrate this SwiftUI implementation:

1. Update `AppDelegate.swift` to conditionally show SwiftUI views
2. Implement Firebase authentication integration
3. Add navigation between SwiftUI and web views
4. Configure proper app lifecycle management
5. Add additional screens as needed

## Usage

The SwiftUI views can be previewed in Xcode using the Preview Canvas. The `LeirisondaApp.swift` serves as the main entry point for a pure SwiftUI version of the app.
