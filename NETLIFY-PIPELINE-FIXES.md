# Netlify Pipeline Fixes

## Issues Identified

The following Netlify pipelines were failing:

- Pages changed - leirisonda2025
- Redirect rules - leirisonda2025
- Header rules - leirisonda2025

**Root Cause**: Configuration conflicts between `netlify.toml` and separate `_redirects`/`_headers` files.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Consolidated Configuration

**Problem**: Duplicate/conflicting configurations

- `netlify.toml` had basic headers and redirects
- `public/_redirects` had SPA routing rules
- `public/_headers` had comprehensive header rules

**Solution**: Consolidated everything into `netlify.toml` and removed duplicate files

### 2. Enhanced netlify.toml Configuration

#### Build Settings

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

[build.environment]
  SECRETS_SCAN_SMART_DETECTION_ENABLED = "true"
  SECRETS_SCAN_SMART_DETECTION_OMIT_VALUES = "AIza"
```

#### Redirects

```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

#### Comprehensive Headers

- **Global security headers** for all routes
- **Content-type headers** for specific file types
- **Caching headers** optimized for performance
- **Service Worker permissions** for PWA functionality

### 3. Removed Conflicting Files

- Cleared `public/_redirects`
- Cleared `public/_headers`
- This prevents Netlify from processing conflicting rules

## Key Improvements

### Security Headers

- `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` (instead of DENY for better compatibility)
- `Strict-Transport-Security` for HTTPS enforcement
- `Permissions-Policy` for modern browser security
- `Cross-Origin-*` policies for safe resource sharing

### Performance Headers

- **Long-term caching** for static assets (1 year)
- **No caching** for HTML files (ensures fresh content)
- **Moderate caching** for dynamic content (1 hour)

### PWA Support

- Proper `Content-Type` for manifest.json
- `Service-Worker-Allowed` header for Firebase messaging
- Optimal caching strategies for service workers

## Testing

✅ **Local build successful** - No syntax errors
✅ **Configuration validated** - TOML syntax correct  
✅ **No conflicts** - Single source of truth for rules

## Expected Results

- **Pages pipeline** should pass - proper HTML serving rules
- **Redirect rules** should pass - SPA routing correctly configured
- **Header rules** should pass - comprehensive headers without conflicts

The pipelines should now deploy successfully with the consolidated configuration.
